 TODO
=========================

* Conditions
* Loops
* Proper integer types (i8, i16, i32, i64)
* Pointers
* Subscript operator (like C's)
* Proper runtime library
* String concatenation + force user to explicitly allow otherwise implicit memory allocations (so the user is aware that they have to free it)
